I liked creating really complex systems, fine arts, music, design, algebra, etc. And being an inventor was the only job title where I could combine these things together; the only job where I could be really creative.</p>

And that is nighter the definition of an inventor nor an academic researcher but to me it&#39;s what I always wanted: Be free to explore my ideas.</p>
