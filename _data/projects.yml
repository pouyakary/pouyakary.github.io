      description: DesignTalk is a playground for implementing ideas of an illustration software. The idea is to play with possibilities of interface design and track how much it can improve the state of software's comfort. DesignTalk implements a a new approach of interface design where only the common tools are visual and they are all visible in the side of a selected object to minimize the interface and then every other task is given using an english like language by speaking it.




- topic: Orchestra
  description: Since 1950's the syntax of regular languages are kept the same, while today we have much more computational capabilities, due to the syntax of regular expressions one cannot write a big pattern inside of it. Orchestra is a new visual language that makes it easy and safe to write scalable patterns, It both compiles to RegExp and can be compiled from RegExp which makes it easy to be used in any host language.
